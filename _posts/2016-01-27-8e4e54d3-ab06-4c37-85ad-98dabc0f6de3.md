## Our Story

Soul Flour Bakery took root in 2007\. We (_James Ferraris and [Erica Ekrem][0]) _opened a pop up, slow-food cafe featuring a menu of organic wholegrain foods _(including pizza... always pizza) _influenced by the philosophies of Weston A. Price, Tassajara, and others, and began offering baked goods at the Orcas Island Farmer's Market. Soon after, our sweet 'bun in the oven,' Eden Luca, was born and life as family took root.

In 2008, James managed an organic, seed-to-plate market garden in partnership with chef Abigael Birrell of Doe Bay Cafe. He also lent his culinary skill to the cafe and was part of the team that developed Doe Bay Pizza and Open Mic Night.

In 2010, our son Natteo was born and James decided it was time to build the mobile wood-fired oven he had been talking about for years. After studying and drafting plans, he teamed with local blacksmith, [Jorgen Harle][1], to forge a wood-fired oven within a modified horse trailer. Upon completion of the hearth, the _Roaming Hearth Pizza_ oven was clad in rough-milled cedar and outfitted for the road with generous help from friends. Turns out farm-fresh, hot-from-the-oven pizza can fuel an amazing work party.
