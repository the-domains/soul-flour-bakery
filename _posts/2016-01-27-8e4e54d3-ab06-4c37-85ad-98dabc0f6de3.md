## Our Story

Soul Flour Bakery began in 2007\. James__Ferraris and [Erica Ekrem][0] opened a slow-food cafe featuring a menu of organic, wholefood items influenced by the philosophies of Weston A. Price, Tassajara, and others, and began offering baked goods at the Orcas Island Farmer's Market. In 2008, James managed an organic, seed-to-plate market garden in partnership with chef Abigael Birrell of Doe Bay Cafe. James also worked in the cafe and was part of the team that launched Doe Bay Pizza and Open Mic Night. By 2010, it was time to build the mobile wood-fired oven James had been talking about for years. After studying and drafting the design, he teamed with local blacksmith, [Jorgen Harle][1], to forge a wood-fired oven within a modified horse trailer. Upon completion, the _Roaming Hearth Pizza_ oven was clad in rough-milled cedar and outfitted for the road with generous help from friends. Turns out farm-fresh, hot-from-the-oven pizza can fuel a productive work party.
