**_OUR FOOD._**
![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/5fac70b8-27b9-4445-9f35-222bb3bedc60.jpg)

Pairing seasonal, local ingredients with thoughtful preparation, we make slow, unassuming food in a break bread way to nourish our family and yours. Our choice of ingredients reflect a desire for a sustainable, healthy environment: wholegrain, GMO-free, organic produce sourced on Orcas Island. Truly believing we are what we eat, our food is made with good intention and meant to nourish the bellies and hearts of friends & community alike. â€‹
