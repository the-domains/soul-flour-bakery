OUR FOOD--Pairing seasonal, local ingredients with thoughtful preparation, we make slow, unassuming food in a break bread way to nourish our family and yours. Our choice of ingredients reflect a desire for a sustainable, healthy environment: wholegrain, GMO-free, organic produce sourced on Orcas Island. Truly believing we are what we eat, our food is made with good intention and meant to nourish the bellies and hearts of friends & community alike. â€‹
