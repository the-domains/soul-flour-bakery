# Pairing seasonal, locally grown ingredients with thoughtful preparation, we make slow, unassuming food in a break bread way to nourish our family and yours. 

Our choice of ingredients reflect a desire for a sustainable, healthy environment within and without. All our products are GMO free. Our baked goods are made with organic wholegrain flours and unrefined sugars. Our in-house sourdough pizzas crusts are topped with organic mozzarella and seasonal, locally-grown produce. Truly believing we are what we eat, our food is made with good intention and meant to nourish the bellies and hearts of friends & community alike. â€‹
